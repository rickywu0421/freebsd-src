.Sh DESCRIPTION
The 
.Nm
utility controls two aspects of the wtap system: 
device manipulation and visibility control. 
.Pp
The device manipulation function allows users to 
create and delete wtap devices, and once a device is created, 
users can use 
.Xr ifconfig 8 
to create network interfaces on top of the wtap device.
.Pp
The visibility control function manages the 
visibility of the wtap devices.
.Sh EXAMPLES
For example, create two wtap devices, and allow them to transmit 
packets to each other :
.Pp
.Dl # wtapctl device create 0
.Pp
.Dl # wtapctl device create 1
.Pp
.Dl # wtapctl vis add 0 1
.Pp
.Dl # wtapctl vis add 1 0
.Pp
Show the list of wtap devices:
.Pp
.Dl # wtapctl device list
.Pp
Check the devices wtap0 can reach:
.Pp
.Dl # wtapctl vis show 0
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr net80211 4 ,
.Xr ieee80211 9 ,

utility first appeared in FreeBSD 14.0.
